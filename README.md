# GPG Chat Platform - SGCC

A simple, stateless, and GPG-based chat platform with a CGI backend.

This project is an experimental platform that leverages the power of GPG for secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging. The backend is built using a simple Common Gateway Interface (CGI) architecture, making it lightweight and easy to deploy on any server with CGI support.

## Features

* **GPG-Based Encryption:** All messages are encrypted using the GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), a free implementation of the OpenPGP, ensuring end-to-end security and privacy.
* **Lightweight CGI Backend:** The server is written in D language, a high-performance C-like language. Its CGI-based design avoids complex server setups, making it easy to host.
* **Simple API Design:** A straightforward API allows for easy integration with various clients, from simple shell scripts to modern web applications.
* **UNIX Philosophy:** The project embraces the UNIX philosophy, using small, focused programs that do one thing and do it well.
